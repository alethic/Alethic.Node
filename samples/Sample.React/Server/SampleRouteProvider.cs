/// this sits beside that handler rather than wrapping it.
///
/// A real one would know React Router's build manifest, or TanStack Start's route tree, or
/// SvelteKit's manifest, in place of the <c>router</c> array this sample exposes. The shape of the
/// work is the same either way: reach into the running application, read the routes that are
/// already there, and translate them into <see cref="RenderRoute"/>.
