/// The stock <see cref="INodeRequestHandler"/>, and the one most applications need. The handler is called
/// as <c>fetch(request, env, ctx)</c>, which is the shape Cloudflare Workers defines and Deno, Bun,
/// and the framework adapters targeting them all follow. It is named for the handler rather than for
/// any export shape because no standard names the shape, and because a bare function as the default
/// export is accepted here too — what <c>createRequestHandler</c>-style factories produce, and a
/// leniency the convention itself does not have.
///
/// Conformance stops at the handler. The convention's other exports — <c>scheduled</c>,
/// <c>queue</c>, <c>tail</c> — are not called, this being an HTTP handler; and nothing is asked of
/// an application beyond <c>fetch</c>. Asynchronous per-engine startup is the application's own to
/// memoize in module scope, as it would be on Workers, where module scope is per isolate and here it
/// is per engine.
///
/// The module evaluates untouched: no adapter is appended and nothing is serialized on the way in
/// or out. The <c>Request</c> and <c>Response</c> objects are built and taken apart directly on the
/// engine's thread, where those types live.
///
/// A framework whose server protocol does not lower to a fetch handler gets its own handler
/// instead. Reading routes needs no handler of its own: pair an <see cref="INodeRouteProvider"/>
/// with this one.
///
/// Open to derivation, for the specialization that is a variation on this handler rather than a
/// protocol of its own: a host with something to add to the request, or to say about the response,
/// overrides <see cref="HandleAsync"/> and calls back. A handler speaking some other protocol
/// implements <see cref="INodeRequestHandler"/> directly instead — that is the seam for a different
/// conversation with the application, where this is the seam for the same one held differently.
