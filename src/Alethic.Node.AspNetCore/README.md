# Alethic.Node.AspNetCore

Server-side rendering for ASP.NET Core on a real Node runtime embedded in the .NET process, through
[node-api-dotnet](https://github.com/microsoft/node-api-dotnet). No sidecar process, no HTTP hop.

It is libnode, and the package says so. There is no runtime abstraction here and no pretence that
another one could be dropped in underneath.

The engines are [Alethic.Node](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Alethic.Node)'s, which this package builds on, and
which runs on its own in any host, .NET Framework included. Their types live in the `Alethic.Node` namespace, so code
that names the pool says `using Alethic.Node;` as well.

## Three things

**Engines** run JavaScript. A `NodeEnginePool` holds several, each a libnode runtime on its own
thread. This is the only piece registered in DI: it owns the threads, and the whole application
shares one.

**Modules** are Node's. A module is loaded with `require` and cached in `require.cache` by resolved
filename, so it evaluates once per engine and keeps its module scope — the same identity a module
has in any other Node program. This library caches nothing of its own.

**Request handlers and route providers** work over a pool and a module. A request handler answers
HTTP requests; a route provider says what routes the application serves. Separate, because they vary
independently: most applications need no handler written at all, and only their routes are
framework-specific.

```csharp
builder.Services.AddNodeEnginePool(o =>
{
    o.EngineCount = 4;                 // must track the CPU limit; see remarks on the option
    o.MaxConcurrencyPerEngine = 4;     // backpressure, not mutual exclusion
});

var app = builder.Build();
app.UseStaticFiles();
app.UseRouting();                      // explicit, or the fallback outruns static files

// Renders through the application's fetch handler, mounted on a fallback endpoint.
app.MapNodeFetchHandler(o =>
{
    o.Module = NodeModuleSource.FromFile("ssr/server.cjs");
    o.Environment["ApiBaseUri"] = "http://api.internal:8080/";
});

await app.RunAsync();
```

A fetch handler describes no routes, so that mounts one fallback endpoint — see [Routes](#routes)
for an endpoint per route.

## The application contract

`export default { fetch }`, and nothing else:

```js
export default {
    fetch(request, env, ctx) { /* return a Response; sync or async */ },
};
```

This is the handler shape Cloudflare Workers defines and Deno, Bun, and the framework adapters
targeting them follow. Called with all three arguments:

- **`request`** — a real `Request`, built on the engine's thread.
- **`env`** — what only the host knows, from `FetchRequestHandlerOptions.Environment`. Input only:
  the object is built fresh per request. Cloudflare puts live bindings here; this host has strings
  to give, which the convention permits since it leaves the contents to the host.
- **`ctx`** — `waitUntil(promise)` and `passThroughOnException()`. `waitUntil` matters on Workers
  because the isolate is frozen after the response; a pooled engine is not, so the promise runs
  either way and `waitUntil` only keeps its rejection from going unobserved.
  `passThroughOnException` is a no-op — there is no origin behind this to pass through to.

Two deliberate departures, both stated rather than papered over:

- **A bare function default export is accepted** as the handler, which is what
  `createRequestHandler`-style factories produce. Workers does not accept this.
- **`scheduled`, `queue`, and `tail` are not called.** This is an HTTP handler.

Nothing else is asked of an application. There is no init hook and no route export. Asynchronous
per-engine startup is the application's own, memoized in module scope exactly as a Workers
application memoizes per-isolate setup:

```js
let ready;
const start = () => ready ??= connect(env.ApiBaseUri);
```

Module scope is per isolate there and per engine here, and `require.cache` is what makes that true.

| Framework | Entry |
|---|---|
| Hono, Elysia, Nitro (worker preset) | `export default app` |
| React Router 7 / Remix | `export default createRequestHandler(build)` — the bare function is accepted |
| Astro | wrap `app.render(request)` in a few lines |
| SvelteKit | `fetch` calls `server.respond(request)`; `server.init({ env })` memoized in module scope |
| Angular | wrap `AngularAppEngine.handle(request)`, mapping its null to a 404 or the shell |

## The request handler

`INodeRequestHandler` answers requests. That is the whole of it:

```csharp
public interface INodeRequestHandler
{
    Task PrepareAsync(CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);
    Task<HttpResponseMessage> SendAsync(HttpRequestMessage request, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);
}
```

Every implementation runs on the same pooled libnode engines — this is not there to abstract the
runtime. It is there because applications do not all speak the same protocol. `FetchRequestHandler`
is the stock one; a framework whose server protocol does not lower to a fetch handler gets its own.
That is rare, and needing routes is not.

`PrepareAsync` loads the module on every engine so that evaluation — which occupies an engine's
event loop — lands at startup rather than under the first request. A module that cannot be loaded
fails there, and with it the deployment.

## Routes

`INodeRouteProvider` is a separate object, passed alongside a handler:

```csharp
public interface INodeRouteProvider
{
    Task<IReadOnlyList<RenderRoute>> GetRoutesAsync(CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);
}
```

Separate because routing is not part of the fetch convention — that convention describes a handler
and says nothing whatever about routes. Mounting without a provider is not a degradation; it is the
honest outcome, and the application is served whole from the fallback.

Write one by reading the router the framework already has:

```csharp
sealed class MyRouteProvider : INodeRouteProvider
{
    readonly NodeEnginePool pool;
    readonly NodeModuleSource module;

    public MyRouteProvider(NodeEnginePool pool, NodeModuleSource module) =>
        (this.pool, this.module) = (pool, module);

    public Task<IReadOnlyList<RenderRoute>> GetRoutesAsync(CancellationToken ct = default) =>
        pool.RunAsync(module, exports =>
        {
            // On the engine's thread. Nothing is serialized; only plain .NET data leaves the scope.
            var table = NodeModuleExports.Default(exports)["router"];
            ...
        }, ct);
}
```

Note what it does *not* do: nothing about rendering, and nothing shared with the handler in .NET.
Naming the same module on the same pool is the whole of the sharing — Node loads it once per engine,
and both see that instance.

```csharp
var pool = app.Services.GetRequiredService<NodeEnginePool>();
var source = NodeModuleSource.FromFile("ssr/server.cjs");

app.MapNode(
    new FetchRequestHandler(pool, new() { Module = source }),
    new MyRouteProvider(pool, source));
```

Routes come from the framework's own router rather than a declaration maintained beside it, so
nothing is stated twice and nothing can drift. `RenderRoute.Pattern` is a URLPattern pathname — the
WHATWG standard every framework's route grammar lowers to — which the host converts to an ASP.NET
route template; a pattern beyond what a template can express falls to the fallback, losing only its
per-route policy. `RenderMode` is that policy: `Client` (shell only, never rendered), `Server`, or
`Prerender`.

A provider that *throws* fails the deployment. A provider that cannot read the router it was written
for is broken, and that must not pass for an application that simply has no routes.

`MapNode` then:

- Skips routes marked `Client` — whatever already serves the application shell keeps serving them.
- Names each endpoint by the route's `id`, so `LinkGenerator.GetPathByName` builds URLs from the
  router: canonical redirects and sitemaps use the platform facility.
- Calls `ConfigureEndpoint` per route for host policy — output caching by render mode, authorization
  by path, anything the endpoint builder carries.
- Returns an `IEndpointConventionBuilder` over everything it mounted, fallback included, so policy
  for the whole application is one statement: `app.MapNode(handler, routes).RequireAuthorization()`.

Each mapped endpoint carries its `RenderRoute` as metadata, so `EndpointDataSource` enumerates what
was mounted — the mapping method does not hand back a list of its own.

## The pool on its own

The pool is a concrete facility — Alethic.Node's — libnode, on purpose, and usable for any JavaScript work, web or
otherwise. A one-shot puts you on an engine's thread writing ordinary node-api-dotnet:

```csharp
var pool = provider.GetRequiredService<NodeEnginePool>();

var result = await pool.RunAsync(NodeModuleSource.FromFile("tool.cjs"), async exports =>
    (int)await ((JSPromise)exports.CallMethod("transform", input)).AsTask());
```

For several steps that must share one engine — or a claim that outlives a single call — take a lease
instead: `await using var lease = await pool.AcquireAsync();` and run against it. A lease is a
capacity claim and an affinity pin, not exclusivity; engines overlap many concurrent calls anyway.

## Constraints worth knowing

- **Reference the RID-specific `Microsoft.JavaScript.LibNode.<rid>` package** for each runtime you
  deploy to. The umbrella package depends on every platform at once and lands ~640 MB of native
  libraries in the output.
- **Engine count must be configured, never derived.** Inside a container the processor count
  reports the host's cores, not the quota. One engine already overlaps many concurrent renders,
  because everything a module awaits yields to its event loop; engines exist for CPU parallelism.
- **CommonJS only.** The embedded runtime registers no dynamic-import callback, so ES modules and
  `import()` do not resolve. Bundle fully static — for esbuild, `--format=cjs` with code splitting
  off.
- **Module scope is shared across concurrent renders on an engine**, since the module is loaded once
  and reused. Per-request state belongs in the request, not at module scope.
- **A rebuilt bundle is not picked up.** `require.cache` holds a module for the runtime's life, so
  rebuilding while the server runs changes nothing until restart.
- **Responses stream.** A failure after the first byte can truncate the body but cannot change the
  status.
- **Cancellation aborts the render**, through `AbortSignal` on the request, not merely the wait.
