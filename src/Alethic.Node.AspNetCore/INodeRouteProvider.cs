/// A separate object from the <see cref="INodeRequestHandler"/> it accompanies, because answering
/// requests and knowing the routes vary independently. The <c>fetch</c> convention describes a
/// handler and says nothing whatever about routes, so an application can want its framework's routes
/// read while needing no request handler of its own — the stock one already answers it. Pairing a
/// provider with a handler costs one object; folding both into one class would cost a wrapper whose
/// only content is forwarding.
///
/// Writing one means knowing a particular framework well enough to read the router the application
/// is actually dispatching on. That is the point: routes come from the one place that already has
/// them, rather than a second declaration maintained alongside and free to drift.
///
/// Mounting without one is not a degradation — it is the honest outcome for a protocol that
/// describes no routes, and the application is served whole from the fallback endpoint.
