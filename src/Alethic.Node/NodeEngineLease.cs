/// A claim on one engine's capacity, and the way onto its thread.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Code inside <see cref="RunAsync{T}(Func{Task{T}})"/> executes on the engine's JavaScript thread
/// and writes ordinary node-api-dotnet — <see cref="JSValue"/>, <see cref="JSPromise"/>,
/// <see cref="JSReference"/> — under that library's own rules. The two that matter most: a
/// <see cref="JSValue"/> is valid only within the scope that produced it, and awaiting ends that
/// scope even without leaving the thread, so anything held across an await goes through a
/// <see cref="JSReference"/>; and nothing produced inside may escape except as plain .NET data.
///
/// Every promise-shaped member has an async form only: a promise settles when the engine's loop
/// turns, and a thread blocked inside a synchronous callback is exactly what stops it turning. The
/// synchronous twins — <see cref="Run{T}(Func{T})"/> and friends — exist for work whose value is
/// produced synchronously on the engine's thread, where they save a task's ceremony.
///
/// Disposal returns the capacity, nothing more. Work already posted to the engine runs to
/// completion regardless, which is what lets a caller start something long-lived and release its
/// claim by another route.
